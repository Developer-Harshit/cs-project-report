      <h2>Python</h2>
      <p>
        Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its
        readability and simplicity. Created by Guido van Rossum, Python
        emphasizes code readability, reducing the cost of program maintenance.
        It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
        object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's extensive standard
        library and active community make it suitable for diverse applications,
        from web development to scientific computing and artificial
        intelligence. Its interpreter-based nature allows for quick prototyping
        and development.

        <h3>1.Random Module</h3>
        <p>
          Random module in Python defines a series of functions for generating
          or manipulating random integers. Python random() is a pseudo-random
          number generator function that generates a random float number between
          0.0 and 1.0, is used by functions in the random module.

        <h3>2.GUI Library</h3>
        <p>
          Python has a huge number of GUI frameworks (or toolkits) available for
          it like tkinter and pygame.GUI stands for Graphical User Interface,
          and refers to computer programs that provide a visual means for users
          to interact with an underlying application or system.
