    <h1>Sudoku</h1>
    <p>
      Sudoku is a logic-based, number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the
      objective is to fill a 9 x 9 grid with digits so that each column, each
      row, and each of the nine 3 x 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also
      called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1
      to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a
      well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
    </p>
    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>
      Backtracking is an algorithmic technique whose goal is to use brute force
      to find all solutions to a problem. It entails gradually compiling a set
      of all possible solutions. Because a problem will have constraints,
      solutions that do not meet them will be removed.

// A* Search Algorithm
1.  Initialize the open list
2.  Initialize the closed list
    put the starting node on the open 
    list (you can leave its f at zero)

3.  while the open list is not empty
    a. find the node with the least f on 
       the open list, call it "q"

    b. pop q off the open list
  
    c. generate q's 8 successors and set their 
       parents to q
   
    d. for each successor
        i. if successor is the goal, stop search
        
        ii. else, compute both g and h for successor
          successor.g = q.g + distance between 
                              successor and q
          successor.h = distance from goal to 
          successor (This can be done using many 
          ways, we will discuss three heuristics- 
          Manhattan, Diagonal and Euclidean 
          Heuristics)
          
          successor.f = successor.g + successor.h

        iii.  if a node with the same position as 
            successor is in the OPEN list which has a 
           lower f than successor, skip this successor

        iV.  if a node with the same position as 
            successor  is in the CLOSED list which has
            a lower f than successor, skip this successor
            otherwise, add  the node to the open list
     end (for loop)
  
    e. push q on the closed list
    end (while loop)

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Sudoku, a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle, has gained immense popularity as a challenging and engaging game. Originating from Switzerland in the 18th century, Sudoku became a global sensation in the early 21st century. The game consists of a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids, each containing nine cells. The objective is to fill the grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits without repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary objective of this project is to implement a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithmâ€”a powerful technique commonly employed for solving constraint satisfaction problems. Backtracking involves a systematic exploration of all possible solutions, undoing the previous choices whenever the algorithm determines that they cannot lead to a valid solution.

Beyond solving Sudoku, this project aims to provide a visual representation of the solving process. Visualization enhances our understanding of the algorithm's decision-making at each step, offering insights into the intricate strategies employed by the solver. The combination of backtracking and visualization not only demonstrates the effectiveness of the backtracking algorithm but also serves as an educational tool for those interested in algorithmic problem-solving and game optimization. Through this project, we explore the intersection of programming, logic, and visual representation, contributing to the broader field of recreational mathematics and algorithmic visualization.

<h1>Implementation</h1>
    <p>
      <pre>Implementation

Iterative Backtracking:

The iterative backtracking is a key algorithm used in this Sudoku solver. Sudoku is a classic example of a problem that can be efficiently solved using the backtracking approach. The iterative backtracking in this code is implemented in the Solver class. It systematically explores the possible solutions to the Sudoku puzzle, backtracking when it reaches a dead-end. The algorithm efficiently explores the solution space by filling cells with valid numbers and backtracking when an invalid state is encountered.

python
def solve(self):
      if self.program.state in [0, 2, 3]:
          return
      curr = self.get_empty()
      if not curr:
          self.program.state = 2
          return
      self.program.current = curr

      values = []
      for i in range(1, 10):
          if i not in curr.tracked:
              values.append(i)
      self.valid_rows(curr, values)
      self.valid_cols(curr, values)
      self.valid_subgrid(curr, values)

      if not values:
          return self.backtrack(curr)

      curr.value = values[randint(0, len(values) - 1)]
      curr.tracked.append(curr.value)
      self.closedset.append(curr)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Board, Cell, Solver Classes

The code utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to model the entities involved in the Sudoku solver. The key classes are:

Board Class: Represents the Sudoku board. It contains cells arranged in a 9x9 grid.

Cell Class: Represents an individual cell on the Sudoku board. Each cell has a position (x, y) and a value.

Solver Class: Manages the solving logic. It utilizes backtracking to solve the Sudoku puzzle.

These classes encapsulate the properties and behaviors associated with the respective entities, promoting modularity and code organization.

Data Structure of Board, Cell, Solver Classes:

Board Class:

self.cells: 2D list representing the Sudoku grid.
self.size: Size of each cell in pixels.
self.offset: Offset to position the board on the screen.
Cell Class:

self.x, self.y: Coordinates of the cell.
self.value: Value of the cell (0 for empty).
self.tracked: List to keep track of the chosen values during backtracking.
Solver Class:

self.cells: Reference to the cells on the Sudoku board.
self.program: Reference to the main program.
self.closedset: List of cells that have been filled during the solving process.
Visualizing Board Using Pygame:

The Pygame library is used to create a graphical user interface for the Sudoku solver. The Main class initializes the Pygame window and handles user input. The Solver class interacts with the Board and Cell classes to visualize the Sudoku board and the solving process.

The code renders the Sudoku grid, displays numbers in cells, and highlights the current cell and cells filled during backtracking. The graphical representation enhances the user experience and provides a visual representation of the solving algorithm.

These implementations and design choices contribute to a clear and organized structure, making the codebase more readable and maintainable. Additionally, the use of OOP principles allows for easy extension and modification of the Sudoku solver.</pre>

    <h1>backtracking approach</h1>
    <p>
      <pre>1. Backtracking Approach
Overview:
Backtracking is a systematic and recursive algorithmic technique for finding all possible solutions to a problem. It is particularly useful for solving problems with a combination of choices and constraints, where an incorrect choice at any step requires undoing the previous choices and making alternative selections.

Application in Sudoku Solver:
In the Sudoku solver project, backtracking is employed to systematically explore and fill in the values for each cell in the Sudoku grid. When the solver encounters a cell without a valid value, it backtracks to the previous state and explores alternative values for the current cell. This process continues until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.</pre>
    </p>
