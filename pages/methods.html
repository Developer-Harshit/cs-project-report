        <h3>Stack</h3>
        <p>
          A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO
          (Last-In-First-Out) principle. Stack has one end, whereas the Queue
          has two ends (front and rear). It contains only one pointer top
          pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack. Whenever an
          element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack,
          and the element can be deleted only from the stack. In other words, a
          stack can be defined as a container in which insertion and deletion
          can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack.

        <h3>2D Array</h3>
        <p>
          A two-dimensional array, also known as a 2D array, is a collection of
          data elements arranged in a grid-like structure with rows and columns.
          Each element in the array is referred to as a cell and can be accessed
          by its row and column indices/indexes.

      <h2>OOP</h2>
      <img src="/images/oop.png" class="full" />
      <p>
        Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects
        in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world
        entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The
        main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that
        operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data
        except that function.
      </p>

      <h2>Backtracking</h2>
      <p>
        Backtracking is a systematic and recursive algorithmic technique for
        finding all possible solutions to a problem. It is particularly useful
        for solving problems with a combination of choices and constraints,
        where an incorrect choice at any step requires undoing the previous
        choices and making alternative selections.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In the Sudoku solver project, backtracking is employed to systematically
        explore and fill in the values for each cell in the Sudoku grid. When
        the solver encounters a cell without a valid value, it backtracks to the
        previous state and explores alternative values for the current cell.
        This process continues until a solution is found or all possibilities
        are exhausted.
