      <h2>What is Sudoku</h2>
      <img src="./public/images/sudoku.png" class="left" />

      <p>
        Sudoku, a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle, has gained
        immense popularity as a challenging and engaging game. Originating from
        Switzerland in the 18th century, Sudoku became a global sensation in the
        early 21st century. The game consists of a 9x9 grid divided into nine
        3x3 subgrids, each containing nine cells. The objective is to fill the
        grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, each column, and
        each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains

      <h2>Sudoku Solving Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        Sudoku-solving algorithms employ various strategies, with Constraint
        Propagation and the Backtracking Algorithm being prominent.

      <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Brute Force Algorithm:</h3>
        <p>
          The brute force approach involves exhaustively checking all possible
          combinations to find a solution. This method, while straightforward,
          is computationally expensive, as it systematically explores every
          potential arrangement without leveraging specific rules or
          constraints.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>Backtracking Algorithm:</h3>
        <p>
          In the backtracking approach, the algorithm systematically explores
          possibilities and backtracks upon encountering conflicts. It
          efficiently narrows down valid choices, reducing unnecessary
          exploration. This method proves effective in solving Sudoku puzzles,
          ensuring adherence to the game's rules.

        <h3>Constraint Propagation:</h3>
        <p>
          Constraint propagation focuses on iteratively reducing possibilities
          by applying constraints. This approach involves rules such as
          elimination and only-choice, continuously narrowing down feasible
          options. By propagating constraints throughout the Sudoku grid, this
          method enhances efficiency and reduces the overall solution space.

      <h2>Objective</h2>

      <p>
        The main objective of this project, "Python Sudoku Solver with
        Visualization," is to develop a sophisticated Sudoku solver using the
        backtracking algorithm in Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        The secondary objective is to create an interactive visualization of the
        Sudoku board, illustrating the step-by-step solving process. This visual
        representation will serve as a valuable educational tool, allowing users
        to observe and comprehend the application of the backtracking algorithm.
