        <h3>Stack</h3>
        <img src="./public/images/stack.png" class="right" />
        <p>
          A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO
          (Last-In-First-Out) principle. Stack has one end, whereas the Queue
          has two ends (front and rear).A stack can be defined as a container in
          which insertion and deletion can be done from the one end known as the
          top of the stack.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the Sudoku solver project,the closedset stack keeps track of
          previously explored cells, allowing the solver to efficiently
          backtrack when encountering invalid states

        <h3>2D Array</h3>
        <div class="dual">

          <p>
            A two-dimensional array, also known as a 2D array, is a collection
            of data elements arranged in a grid-like structure with rows and
            columns. Each element in the array is referred to as a cell and can
            be accessed by its row and column indices/indexes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In the context of Sudoku solving, the 2D array represents the sudoku
          grid, with each cell storing a digit and it's grid coordinate.
          Efficiently navigating and manipulating this array is crucial for
          implementing the backtracking algorithm.

      <h2>OOP</h2>
      <img src="./public/images/oop.png" class="full" />
      <p>
        Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects
        in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world
        entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that
        operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data
        except that function.
      </p>

      <h2>Backtracking</h2>
      <p>
        Backtracking, a recursive algorithmic technique, systematically explores
        and finds solutions to problems with choices and constraints. In the
        Sudoku solver project, backtracking is pivotal. It guides the systematic
        filling of Sudoku grid cells. When encountering an invalid state, the
        algorithm backtracks, undoing choices and exploring alternative values
        until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
